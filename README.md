# Lyndon's init.vim/.vimrc

These are my current vim configuration files.

Originally I used `vim` 8+ but will be switching to `neovim`. I have included my
original .vimrc file for reference but will be deleting everything and starting
from scratch.  
I will focus on compatability with `neovim`.

Originally I was using Vundle for my plugins.
