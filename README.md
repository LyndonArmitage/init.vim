# Lyndon's NeoVim Config

These are my current [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configuration
files.

These were rewritten from Vimscript to Lua at the end of 2023.

They require NeoVim 0.9+.

## Plugin Management

For my first Vim configuration I used
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vipm), then I switched to
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Currently
[packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) is being used to take
advantage of NeoVims features.
